This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures.  The function `potentialBug` attempts to compute the sum of a list generated by `generateList`. However, `generateList` produces an infinite list, leading to non-termination if `potentialBug` is called without careful consideration.
